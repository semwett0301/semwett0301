## 🎯 Objective  
I’m a full-stack developer with experience in both frontend and backend, and I’m currently expanding into machine learning and AI. I focus on building solutions that are scalable, reliable, and user-friendly.

This GitHub serves as my portfolio — with projects from my bachelor’s, master’s, and personal/open-source work.

👉 This link is also included in my [CV](./CVs/Mokrov_Simon_Fullstack_CV (3).pdf).
